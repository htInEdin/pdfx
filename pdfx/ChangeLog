	* backends.py: Restructure references to distinguish scraped
		       	vs. from annotations, abandoning old reftype as incoherent
		      PDFMinerBackend:
		       Wrap TextConverter output ByteIO with TextIOWrapper
		       Expose doc as property to aid debugging
		       Template for debug logging
		       Log exceptions in ref scraping and re-raise
		       Remove separate support for arxiv URIs
		       Refactor resolve_PDFObjRef to clarify logic and
		       	handle more cases
		       Fall back to iso-8859-1 if UTF-8 doesn't work
