	* __init__.py (PDFx.__init__): Add readTimeout, textTimeout and limit args
        readTimeout if present is a timeout after which we give
         up trying to read and raise PDFReadTimeout
        textTimeout if present is a timeout post-reading after which
          if limit we try again w/o LAParams (i.e we don't process and
                                              layout the text),
          otherwise we raise PDFTextTimeout
        textTimeout with limit makes sense if you only care about annotations,
          e.g. if you're looking for URI references
	
        * __init__.py (PDFx.buildStream): factored out of __init__ to facilitate the above
